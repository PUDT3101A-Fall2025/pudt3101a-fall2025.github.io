This course provides production and coding skills for projects involved in Core Studio: DT3 - Systems.

Students will expand their understanding of acquiring and processing data sets. They will learn about form, function and techniques for developing virtual and physical networked systems, interactive environments, objects and processes.

Primary technical subjects include creating and publishing web content using HTML, CSS, and
Javascript; working with data APIs; and project documentation.
Beyond the technical skills covered, we will pay attention to the following themes as they relate to the internet as a system, the building blocks that it is comprised of, and coding as a practice:
* Naming
* Representation
* Structure and hierarchies
* Absence and uncertainty
* Transparency and opaqueness
* Accessibility

We will ask:
* What can we do to nurture an inclusive, critical, and caring web development practice?
* What are the social, historical, and political contexts of the tools and technologies used for web
development?
* What are the political implications of various data schemas?
