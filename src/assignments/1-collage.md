Assigned: September 3, 2025<br/>

A key influence on the design of the web are the concepts of [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) and [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia)—electronic text and multimedia documents with non-linear links and cross-references. This method of joining disparate materials evokes the practice of collage, a major artistic strategy of the 20th century. Choose a subject that’s interesting to you and create a web-based collage exploring it. It can be a personal scrapbook, a documentary or guide, or a work of fiction or speculative design. It may include interactive JavaScript elements, but **your collage should be primarily HTML and CSS incorporating text and images as well as other embedded media optionally**.

While assembling your collage, consider the following:

* How can a collage feel alive on a screen in ways a paper collage cannot?
* What kinds of images, shapes, or textures represent your chosen theme or subject?
* How might arrangement affect meaning—does order create a story, or is it meant to feel random and chaotic?
* Consider scale: what happens when one image is huge and others are tiny?
* A grid gives you structure—will you lean into that structure, or try to break it?
* Think about interaction: does the collage invite the viewer to explore, or is it meant to be seen all at once?

### Phases

#### Phase 1: Design

* Choose images and text for each page.
* Sketch out layouts for each page.
* Write out the CSS grid structure for each page, e.g. how many rows and cols you will need for each one, etc.

#### Phase 2: Develop

* Develop your designs into a website with 3 pages.

### Requirements

You will be graded on your technical decisions, especially as they relate to your design. **A successful project will have the following**:

* 3 pages (no more no less) with at least 10 images and 3 lines or blocks of text on each page.
* A mixture of media you create and found items from elsewhere. Any found or AI-generated media should be credited, including links to sources.
* Your text should be styled e.g. using a custom font, sizing, etc.
* Each page should have a different layout using CSS Grid, ~~scaling as necessary to support multiple screen sizes~~.
* You should be able to navigate from page to page using links.
* Appropriate semantic HTML tags for paragraphs, headings, figures and so on.
* Alt tags to describe visual elements and embed any text that’s rendered in an image.
* Readable code using Prettier for consistent white space and code format.

### Submission

Your website should be published to the web using GitHub pages. Submit your assignment by submitting your GitHub pages link in Canvas.
