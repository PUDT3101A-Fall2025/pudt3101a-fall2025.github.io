Assigned: September 22, 2025<br/>
**DUE: October 13, 2025 at 12:00PM**

### Overview

In this assignment you’ll use HTML, CSS and Eleventy.js to create a collection, e.g. 

- A collection of blog posts.
- A collection of items and descriptions of items you collect
- A collection of your favorite artist’s songs or albums
- A collection of your favorite movies or TV shows
- A collection of your friends or family
- A collection of your memories
- A collection of projects

### Creative Considerations

- What kind of website will make you want to add to your collection regularly?
- Templates are a way for us to structure our thoughts and information. What do you want to include in your template to give shape and format to your content?
- How can your website be a [digital garden](https://x.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880)?
